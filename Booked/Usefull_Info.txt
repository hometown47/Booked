Thing of Note

Stting Up Debug
===============

Using XDEBUG.
Add the [xdebug] section into the php.ini
Add the extension_dir folder in the php.ini
i.e extension_dir =  "/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20131226"


Database setup
==============

Make sure the user has enough privileges - when I first set up the user it was against the specific database and didn't work as expected...

Email Setup
===========

Admin Confing Online
Need CHMOD for config.php


table membership_id
id = AUTO_INCREMENT and sys_insert_tstmp defaults to current timestamp;


mysql_query("INSERT INTO membership_id VALUES (NULL, NULL)", $conn_id);

This will return the value that was generated
$req = mysql_insert_id($conn_id)
